# Information

This opensource initiative is newly created and headed by [Glader/HelloKitty](https://github.com/hellokitty) a .NET/C#/Unity3D/Network/Server developer who has experience in building network game backends. [Glader/HelloKitty](https://github.com/hellokitty) leads and develops for [FreecraftCore](https://github.com/freecraftcore) which is an in-development next generation .NET client/server emulation project for World of Warcraft private servers. [Glader/HelloKitty](https://github.com/hellokitty)
also leads and develops the [Booma Project](https://github.com/boomanation) which is a ground-up recreation of the Phantasy Star Online game utilizing Unity Technologies' Unity3D engine. [Glader/HelloKitty](https://github.com/hellokitty) is also the developer of a high-level networking API called [GladNet2](https://github.com/HelloKitty/GladNet2) which provides a productive API around networking library implementations such as [Lidgren-gen3](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3) on top of a collection of other Unity3D tools and libraries.

[Glader/HelloKitty](https://github.com/hellokitty) is now bringing those technologies that power the Phantasy Star Online remake, GladNet2 and the experience and knowledge gathered from building a next-generation World of Warcraft emulator to an open-source Endless Ages project.
